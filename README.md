# carbon-commuter

Carbon Commuter is a website
that provides Los Angeles commuters
with ready information about their commutes.
Given a home and work address,
we compare
the duration,
carbon output
and calories burned
by different commuting options.
Calculations are based on
default assumptions about how the commute is performed
e.g. that work arrival and departure
are for a 9-5 job,
and that drives are made
with a "standard car."

Users can further refine their results
by providing as much information as they desire.
